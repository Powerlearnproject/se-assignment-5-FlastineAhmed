      I set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter next to the line number.
      I opened the Run and Debug view by clicking on the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar.
      I clicked on the Run and Debug button to start debugging.
      I selected the appropriate debugging configuration if prompted.
      Key debugging features:
      Breakpoints: Pause program execution at specific lines.
      Step controls: Step over, into, or out of functions.
      Watch variables: Monitor the value of variables in real-time.
      Call stack: View the call stack to trace function calls.
      Debug console: Execute commands and evaluate expressions during debugging.
10. Using Source Control:

      I opened the project folder in VS Code by selecting File > Open Folder and navigating to the desired directory.
      I opened a new terminal in VS Code by selecting Terminal > New Terminal or pressing Ctrl+ (backtick).
      In the terminal, I selected Git Bash by clicking on the drop-down menu on the right side of the terminal and choosing Git Bash.
      I initialized a Git repository by running the following command:
         git init
      I made changes to my files in the project.
      I staged the changes by running the following command in the Git Bash terminal:
         git add .
      I committed the changes with a descriptive message by running:
         git commit -m "Initial commit"
      I created a new repository on GitHub by navigating to GitHub and clicking on the New button to create a new repository.
      I copied the repository URL.
      I added the remote repository in Git Bash by running:
         git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
      I pushed the commits to the GitHub repository by running:
         git push -u origin master
